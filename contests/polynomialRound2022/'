// The repeat operations just spawn in new pigs below kinda
// just shift all living ones down by sum of decrements so far
// This might be good with a segment tree potentially
// my current idea would be O(n^2) I think due to the shifting
// I'm trying to think of a way to do it more efficiently
// The shifting is the part in this idea that is slow
// when new pigs are spawned they won't be affected by repeats
// they will be affected by decrements
// might be like dp with a lazy segment tree
// once you get all the elements you need to shift them down
// we need to take advantage of the low health values
// In my current approach just the decrements would also take O(n)
// this could be accomplished with shifts?
// actually I don't think that would work
// I wrote up the O(n^2) code and it got a runtime error
// That was because I forgot to apply the mod everywhere
// Now I get tle on pretest 8
// Unsure how to do the decrement efficiently
// maybe use a queue? this would be O(n) still tho
// I can do the decrement efficiently if I am allowed O(n^2)
// for the memory complexity, however this doesn't pass
// maybe do this with a map?
// do lazy updates to all of the elements?
// unsure how this would help the decrement tho
// store ranges to clear and use a circular array?
// I don't think that lazy updates for the shifts would be that
// helpful
// lookup for this would be too slow
// I have looked at the editorial, it is very similar to what
// I was doing but, it just uses a map instead of an array
// We also need to do this thing with modular inverse for when
// we are doubling values
